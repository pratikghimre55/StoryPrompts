The typewriter clacked in the dim room, each keystroke a release of words he couldn't say aloud, a solitary symphony for a world that never bothered to listen.
The soft glow of the desk lamp cast long shadows, enveloping him in a cocoon of creativity as he continued to pour his soul onto the page.
He was sitting in the vacation with his wife and two children at the hotel "The Overlook".
All seemed commonly, but the typewriter felt something wrong, but he couln't name it.
The house suddenly caught on fire and he jumped out the window.
